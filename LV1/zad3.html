    <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
    <p> 
      Dear Eileen,<br>
      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of 
      Awesome's science faculty to study<br> as part of your PhD next year. I will
      answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.  
    </p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>
      We are happy to accomaodate your starting your study with us at any time,
      however it would suit us better if you <br>could start at the beginning of a 
      semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 Semester 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 Januar 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
      <br>
      You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.
    </p>

    <h3>Subject of study</h3>
    <p>
      At the Awesome Science FAculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as
      long as the subject fall<br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. 
      You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd 
      like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
      by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefots of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeeding
        30°C(86°F), when the audience size exponenntially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> 
        &#62; 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
      including how long you'd expect the<br> research to take, require staff and 
      other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <h3>Excotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic trical dances.
      To answer your questions my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
      <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,
        a whole village dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be 
        "fruitful".
      </dd>

      <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
      <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used
        to practice this dance, which <br>involved guddlling close together in a circle on the floor, and 
        shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students
        used to say that he thought this dance inspires<br> modern styles such as Twerking.
      </dd>

      <dt>Arctic robor dance</dt>
      <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
        belived to have<br>discovered a new dance style characterise by "robotic", stilted 
        movements, being praacticed by inhabitants <br>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later in however 
        it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were eally cold.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    Yours sincerely,<br> Dr Eleanor Gaye<br> University of Awesome motto: "Be excellent to each other."
